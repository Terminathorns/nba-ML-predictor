# nba-ML-predictor
Hiya! This is my first machine learning project from scratch. It's a Random Forest Predictor for which team will win the NBA championship in a given year.
For the most part, the work is already done for you. All you need to do is make sure to pull the repo, run file_writer.py twice (once to create the training dataset, another to create the current year's dataset), set the directory in which you'd like to save the CSV files in nba_classifier.py, and then run nba_classifier.py.
That's it!
